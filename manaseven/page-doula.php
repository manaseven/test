						<div class="row">
							<p>My favourite description of a Doula is of, “someone who’s role and belief is one of  ‘mothering the mother.”  We ensure the birthing mother is continually and unequivocally supported throughout her birthing journey.</p>
							<p class="no-margin">The Doula is the ultimate protector and advocate not only for the birthing mother but also for her birthing environment. She strives to make sure the mother feels safe and secure as she prepares to welcome her baby into the world.</p>

							<h2 class="title center">What <span>I do</span> as a Doula</h3>
							<ul class="basic">
								<li>Meet with you regularly prenatally (Minimum of two meetups)</li>
								<li>Discuss your birthing options including care providers in your area as well as birthing environments to help enable you to write a birth plan most suited to you and your baby</li>
								<li>Explore any emotions, fears or hopes you have surrounding your birth</li>
								<li>Share with you an array of techniques including simple relaxation, birth breathing and massage to use throughout your pregnancy and during birthing</li>
								<li>Share any information/resources/evidence-based research I feel could help you on your birthing journey: how to make informed decisions and ultimately eliminate unnecessary interventions</li>
								<li>Provide continuous calming support emotionally and physically throughout labour</li>
								<li>Respect and protect your right to birth your way whilst helping when necessary to make things a little more comfortable for you</li>
								<li>Support your birth companion (if you have one) to remain calm and use gentle communication throughout</li>
								<li>Help and support to breastfeed in the initial hours after baby’s birth </li>
								<li>Meet with you once postnatally to discuss your birthing experience and if you require any additional support</li>
							</ul>
							<p><em>Remember</em> - As your Doula, I am not affiliated to anyone be that medical professional, midwifery team or other. My sole responsibility is in caring, supporting, advocating and protecting <strong>you</strong> and <strong>your baby</strong> on your birthing journey - however you choose to birth. </p>

							<h2 class="title center">What <span>I don't do</span> as a Doula</h3>
							<ul class="basic">
								<li>Interfere - especially if things are going well</li>
								<li>Tell you what to do - “your body, your baby, your birth.” I provide guidance when required but all decisions surrounding your birth are made by you</li>
								<li>Carry out any medical/clinical procedures or examinations</li>
								<li>Promise/guarantee you a certain type of birth. Birth by its very nature is spontaneous and unique</li>
