						<p class="center">Ghandi said it best above. We now know that life begins not just at birth but within the womb: the environment, communication, sense of love and self we experience during our early development set the stage for our lives thereafter. It's no surprise then to discover that more and more families are doing their utmost to give their babies the most gentle and peaceful start to life</p>

								<p><strong>In nurturing the creative free spirit of children.</strong> As Picasso once said, “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up”. Our current mainstream education system sadly is not designed to do this. </p>
								<p><strong>We should let kids be kids and let toys be toys.</strong> This means protecting them from the influence of corporations, media and a society adamant on determining their interests based on their gender.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 pad-left">
								<p><strong>Women don’t have to be taught how to birth.</strong> Our bodies do that instinctively. What we do need to learn is what we have forgotten somewhere along the way: that we are strong, we are powerful beyond belief and our bodies are designed to birth.</p>
								<p><strong>Create your own rules.</strong> In life, in parenting, career, wellness, you get the idea. Do what works for you and your family. Be brave enough to step outside the confines of social norms and create the life you desire.</p>
